25-May-13	God Emperor of Dune	Frank Herbert	3	"Better than I remember. Human, funny. What is arafel?"
27-May-13	Heretics of Dune	Frank Herbert	3	"Lots happens, and at the end the conspiracy is revealed, again."
30-May-13	Chapterhouse: Dune	Frank Herbert	3	"Again, so much middle. Cliffhanger too!"
25-Jun-13	Crime and Punishment	Fyodor Dostoevsky	4	This time I'm sure it was about 20-somethings' frustration and impotence
07-Jul-13	"Eggs, Beans, and Crumpets"	P. G. Wodehouse	4	This was a welcome break after Dostoevsky!
12-Jul-13	Made to Stick	Chip & Dan Heath	2	"Some good points, but they take a long time to tell all their stories"
23-Jul-13	My Man Jeeves	P. G. Wodehouse	4	Jeeves is brilliant; but I can tell these are early stories
08-Aug-13	The Heart is a Lonely Hunter	Carson McCullers	2	"Gosh, the long-ago tone and constant misgivings are truly depressing"
19-Aug-13	"I, Claudius"	Robert Graves	4	"Super fun historical fiction, but it does drag in the middle"
25-Aug-13	Wrinkle in Time	Madeleine L'Engle	2	"Ham-fisted, juvenile, and tell-y; I remember not liking it even in middle school!"
07-Sep-13	South	Ernest Shackleton	3	"Just read up to getting to South Georgia, and maybe fast forward some parts about drifting"
29-Sep-13	The Death of Ivan Ilyich & Other Stories	Leo Tolstoy	3	"Prisoner of the Caucus, and Death of II are good; others are extended, moralistic, and brutal"
14-Oct-13	As the Romans Did	Jo-Ann Shelton	4	"Wouldn't read the whole thing through, but lots of great info! (esp. 307, 325, 372)"
20-Oct-13	Game of Thrones	George R. R. Martin	3	"Decent, as a Wheel of Time style"
29-Oct-13	Getting to Yes	"Roger Fisher, William Ury"	5	"Lots of intuitive stuff, but great to have it all laid out; last section got a little tedious"
17-Nov-13	Nostromo	Joseph Conrad	4	Political intrigue; romance; adventure; poetry; awesome.
29-Nov-13	Dracula	Bram Stoker	4	Much more fun than expected; Lucy is sick for a long time; a lot about science's victory over emotion!
07-Dec-13	Frankenstein	Mary Shelley	3	"Sad story, with lots of 18th C. talking; but mostly really sad"
17-Dec-13	The Man in the High Castle	Philip K. Dick	5	"Hard to put down; so many themes (historicity, ambition); Nazis really were crazy"
24-Jan-14	The Complete Roman Army	Adrian Goldsworthy	4	"Excellent intro, nice figures. I want more narratives!"
30-Jan-14	If on a Winter's Night a Traveler	Italo Calvino	5	"Again, amazing. Forest of stories. Every single story! Falsification, computers."
09-Feb-14	The Western Way of War	Victor Hansen	4	Good reading for how the battle looked; not good intro for history
09-Feb-14	On the Origin of Species	Charles Darwin	5	Great read; he answers so many contemporary concerns; but don't read the whole thing
20-Feb-14	Mansfield Park	Jane Austen	3	"Long, and the end has little to do with the middle; very end is predictable!"
12-Mar-14	Sons and Lovers	D. H. Lawrence	3	Wonderful garden beauty intermixed with inscrutable emotions
07-Apr-14	Great Expectations	Charles Dickens	4	Truly sad; a story of young adulthood and screwing it up
06-May-14	Cadillac Desert	Marc Reisner	4	Immensely depressing; make sure you get an updated version; mine stopped in 1986!
14-May-14	Childhood's End	Arthur C. Clarke	4	I think this is my favorite ACC; storytelling is actually purposeful; tough ending!
04-Jun-14	The Fish Can Sing	Halldor Laxness	4	"Witty, hilarious, dark, suitably confusing. Is it a growing-up story?"
17-Jun-14	Stoner	John Williams	6	Profoundly moving. Immensely beautiful.
15-Jul-14	Nonviolent Communication	Marshall Rosenburg	4	Lots of good gems in there; a useful way to think; some good formulae
17-Jul-14	Mist	Miguel de Unamuno	3	A couple neat tricks; moments of amusing introspection
21-Jul-14	Idiot's Complete Guide to Baseball	Johnny Bench	3	"Lots of historical tidbits, but the rules are confusing and there is a lot about late-90s baseball"
01-Aug-14	My Struggle (Vol I)	Karl Ove Knausgaard	5	"Outstanding, page-turning. Best parts of Proust, good parts of Tolstoy."
01-Sep-14	Conquest of the Useless	Werner Herzog	4	"Lots of little awesome observations. Much better having seen his movies, clips, etc."
23-Sep-14	Anathem	Neal Stephenson	3	"A fun, engrossing read. The punch comes suddenly."
19-Oct-14	Souls of Black Folk	W. E. B. DuBois	4	"Often florid, sometimes cutting. Feels like it was written yesterday."
23-Oct-14	Fall of the Roman Empire	Arthur Ferrill	3	"Quick, easy. Good complement to other theories about the fall."
27-Oct-14	Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki	Haruki Murakami	4	"Less supernatural, but enough to shadow some other (maybe better?) story"
14-Nov-14	Tender is the Night	F. Scott Fitzgerald	3	"A captivating story arc, but I don't really like Fitz's style and don't care about rich abroad Americans"
20-Nov-14	Picture of Dorian Gray	Oscar Wilde	4	"Quick, luxurious. After much flinging down of selves into couches, a nonmoral tale."
27-Nov-14	This Time of Darkness	H. M. Hoover	4	2-3 hrs. Really good for young adult fiction! Hunger Games?
30-Nov-14	Ancient Greece	Paul Cartledge	2	"Neither history nor social history, so what did I learn?"
27-Dec-14	My Struggle (Vol II)	Karl Ove Knausgaard	5	"Again, captivating. Subject matter was different, so I was disappointed when I expected a repeated of Vol I."
14-Jan-15	Alexander the Great	Philip Freeman	4	"""Racy, pacey"" story of Alexander's life; I think most of the highlights are here"
28-Feb-15	A History of the World in 12 Maps	Jerry Brotton	4	"Great scholarship, but omg long&dense. recommend ch 1, 3, 9, 11"
13-Mar-15	Claudius the God	Robert Graves	4	"Good history, but not as much fun as part I"
09-Apr-15	Year of the Four Emperors	P. A. L. Greenhalgh	4	Plenty of interesting tidbits; moves quickly. Reminds me of Freeman's book.
11-Apr-15	Into the War	Italo Calvino	4	Outstanding short stories. Are these not fiction?
26-Apr-15	Madame Bovary	Gustave Flaubert	5	Immensely depressing. what happens when we expect something that life simply doesn't give us?
25-May-15	Nemesis	Rich Muller	2	"A cute story of scientific discovery, but the discovery itself is, you know, not true"
30-May-15	My Struggle (Vol III)	Karl Ove Knausgaard	4	"I think this is better than II. Less back-and-forth through time, but vivid episodes."
06-Jun-15	Animal Farm	George Orwell	4	"Oof. What a sad&true story. Maybe about Stalin, but it's broader than that."
29-Jun-15	Ivanhoe	Sir Walter Scott	4	"Cute short story, it's where Robin Hood comes from; you can skip the snory speeches"
04-Jul-15	Archaeology of the Roman Economy	Kevin Greene	3	"a little boring, even for me; but transport & pottery were cool"
28-Jul-15	My Struggle (Vol IV)	Karl Ove Knausgaard	5	Back to #1 level. Chilling and unbearable stories. Absurd ending.
04-Aug-15	Haskell: Art of Functional Programming	Simon Thompson	4	"Best book I found. Least ""applied"" nonsense. I'm prepared for intermediate/advanced!"
04-Aug-15	Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass	Frederick Douglass	5	Religion; depravity of the slaveholder. Crushing insignificances.
09-Aug-15	Design of Everyday Things	Don Norman	3	"First 50 pages were good, about ordinary things; then a lot about machinery and nuclear plants"
28-Aug-15	Seven Principle for Making Marriage Work	Daniel Gottman	4	Good conflict management, etc. A really fun read with a partner!
20-Sep-15	Ethnography in Organizations	Helen Schwartzmann	3	Some good info on how to ask questions in an organization
18-Oct-15	An Enquiry Concerning Human Understading	David Hume	5	Cause & effect, some doubt on religion, and doubt on skepticism
14-Nov-15	Brain on Fire	Susan Cahalan	3	Beginning and middle are fun. What is madness? End DRAGS ON.
09-Dec-15	The Ten Faces of Innovation	Tom Kelley	3	Chapters 1-3 are best. Rest feels very b-schooly.
19-Jan-16	Voices	Ursula K. Le Guin	4	Easy, delicious read. A young girl, reading, invasion, violence.
20-Jan-16	Gifts	Ursula K. Le Guin	3	Not as complex as Voices.
22-Jan-16	Powers	Ursula K. Le Guin	4	A tough story; more like Voices. Gifts is the odd one out.
10-Feb-16	A History of the Balkans	Ferdinand Schevill	3	Between dry and 19th c. voluptuous. Ends in 1920. Lots on intrigue!
11-Feb-16	Apocalyptigirl	Andrew MacLean	4	I love the cat. Clever way to do Voice of God. Cool triangular face visuals.
21-Feb-16	Tuck Everlasting	Natalie Babbitt	4	Quick. It raises the big question and leaves it hanging.
29-Feb-16	Europe before Rome	T. Douglas Price	4	Lots of awesome sites! I should keep this in hand for when I travel.
13-Mar-16	How to read prehistoric monuments	Alan Butler	4	Guy's a little crazy, but very nice review of UK prehistoric sites.
06-Apr-16	QED	Richard Feynman	4	Easy to read, very enlightening. I wished I had read this before Peskin & Schroeder!
12-Apr-16	The Godfather	Mario Puzo	3	Wow, the movie is way better.
15-Apr-16	The Political Brain	Drew Westen	4	Just read Ch. 1, 2, 3, and 6. I only made it up to 8 or 9. Great concept, douchy execution.
??-???-16	The Handmaid's Tale	Margaret Atwood	4	Set in Boston. Terrifying; I love stories that revolve around gender.
16-May-16	Six Frigates	Ian W. Toll	3	Lots of naval history I didn't know. So bloody. Sometimes long-winded.
21-May-16	The Revenant	Michael Punke	3	Language is terrible, and story far-fetched; wilderness survival bits are awesome.
18-Jun-16	The Righteous Mind	Jonathan Haidt	5	Foundations (SCAFLL) is a concept I've been bumbling around for years
21-Jun-16	How Doctors Think	Jerome Groopman	2	Important idea, but super long-winded and boring. The Intro and radiology were the best parts.
20-Jul-16	Concise History of Greece	Richard Clogg	4	Outstanding summary, lovely images. The histories of the elections is a little drawn out, but definitely the best summary I've seen.
05-Aug-16	The Constitution of the Roman Republic	Andrew Lintott	4	You wouldn't expect a book like this to be thrilling, and it's not, but it is thorough and fascinating
04-Sep-16	The Blizzard	Vladimir Sorokin	4	Great little story. So glad I didn't know where it would go.
21-Sep-16	Godel, Escher, Bach	Douglas Hofstadter	3	The parts about Godel get a 4.5. The parts about "the mind" get, like 2 or 3.
09-Oct-16	Joy Luck Club	Amy Tan	3	Movie is way better (or, at least, as I remember). Most stories attempt literature and fall short.
24-Oct-16	Dream of Scipio	Iain Pears	3	Nice (and ambiguous!) story, but the writing is not very good
31-Oct-16	Citizen	Claudia Rankine	4	I love the part 1 poems. Poignant moments of seeing the color in front of the person.
30-Nov-16	SPQR	Mary Beard	5	The Romans don't have anything to teach us, but we have new questions to ask of them.
07-Dec-16	Zen Flesh, Zen Bones	Paul Reps	5	These are where all the good stories come from.
10-Dec-16	Biology as Ideology	Richard Lewontin	4	Chapters 1-3 are a great show of the sociopolitical role of science
07-Jan-17	Lies of Locke Lamora	Scott Lynch	2	A moderately interesting world, but wholly unengaging and unbelievable characters and plot.
11-Jan-17	This won't take but a minute, honey	Steve Almond	3	Writing essays were pretty interesting. Short stories were not for me.
21-Jan-17	An introduction to Zen training	Omori Sogen	3	Some really great sections, among a lot of arcane rambles. Zen Wasan, Intro, Soto vs. Rinzai, etc. were worth it.
27-Jan-17	The Sisters Brothers	Patrick DeWitt	4	Great story. The episodes leave some feeling that something is going to come together. But the whole thing makes fun of that idea.
09-Feb-17	Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind	Shunryu Suzuki	3	Some chapters are golden, but it does go on and on. (Even for being a short book!)
01-Apr-17	The History of Statistics	Stephen Stigler	5	Outstanding read. Lots of great psychology; incredible details. Should be re-read.
16-Apr-17	Quiet	Susan Cain	3	Interesting, if you're an introvert or want some biology. But, like many books, too long.
19-Apr-17	The Shocking History of Phosphorus	John Emsley	2	Weirdly structured. Poor explanation of chemistry. The part about discovery is best. Skip the last few chapters.
18-May-17	Microbe Hunters	Paul de Kruif	5	Delightful, informative, and super-dated.
27-Jun-17	Salonica	Mark Mazower	4	Great stories of Ottomans, Ma'min, etc. A lot of trivia, so very long. Great info re: population exchange.
02-Jul-17	X-Wing: Wraith Squadron	Aaron Allston	2	Fine if you want some Star Wars beach literature.
20-Jul-17	Business Adventures	John Brooks	3	It's impressive that he can make business sound that exciting! The chapters degrade in quality as they go on.
18-Aug-17	From the Holy Mountain	William Dalrymple	4	Very deressing stories of Christians in the Middle East. But really funny considering. Great way to learn about Monophysites, Dyophysites, Miaphysites, etc. Muslims were just weird Christians.
31-Aug-17	Billy Budd	Herman Melville	4	Short, sad, surprising. I can see why it's a Melville favorite. Why did I used to hate this guy so much?
13-Sep-17	Sapiens	Yuval Harari	3	Some good history, and a lot of his theorizing, which is certainly thought-provoking. Origin of the patriarchy, Scientific Revolution, human evolution, etc.
24-Sep-17	Celestial Railroad and Other Stories	Nathaniel Hawthorne	4	Surprisingly good little stories. I got a little tired of men scientists somehow killing women. Celestial Railroad and Grim Fandango?
07-Oct-17	Two Years before the Mast	Richard Henry Dana, Jr.	4	Surprisingly engaging. Stories of people, return to home, etc. will stay for a while. Great complement to Melville, etc.
15-Oct-17	Zen and the Bible	J. K. Kadowaki	3	Interesting, but short premise: zazen is a way to fully engage body/mind with Christian life. Christ had the same save-everyone fervor that Zen Masters have, etc.
21-Nov-17	Homo Deus	Yuval Harari	2	Not worth the time. Good thoughts re: vegetarianism, futures of biology, and humanism. But it takes a *long* time to get there.
03-Dec-17	Design of Experiments	R. A. Fisher	4	Surprisingly lucid and easy read! ANOVA now makes sense to me.
03-Jan-18	Big Chicken	Maryn McKenna	3	Had a bunch of good refs, although I'm still not convinced by how important the farm/medical link is. Chicken of Tomorrow! Also, farm abx went away because they basically don't work anymore.
26-Jan-18	David Copperfield	Charles Dickens	4	Woah, long. But Dickens is delightful for all the stuff that happens in between. You can tell that DC is his "favorite" character, and that it's him.
05-Feb-18	Lean In	Sheryl Sandberg	4	Quick read. Half informational about what's up with women in the workplace; half self-help book about mentoring, feedback, partnerships, etc.
28-Feb-18	Study of Greek Inscriptions	A. G. Woodhead	2	Ponderous and pompous. Some good material in the middle, but not many pictures, and no translations.
07-Mar-18	Greek Inscriptions	B. F. Cook	4	Wow, so much better than Woodhead, who this guy says is the "definitive" book. Translations, more interesting and better pictures, better organization, and 10x less harrumph.
13-Mar-18	Marriage, A History	Stephanie Coontz	3	Really interesting topic. A ton of detail, which could have been cut down on.
18-Mar-18	Reading Roman Inscriptions	John Rogan	2	Re-read. Feels like it was slapped together at the last minute, but a good introduction. The formulas are the most important part.
21-Mar-18	A PhD is not enough	Peter Feibelman	3	Short, quick. A good read for an orientation into these kinds of ideas. Probably good reading for grad students and (esp.) postdocs. Maybe good required reading for folks in a lab!
02-Apr-18	Understanding Roman inscriptions	LJF Keppie	5	Excellent, short, high-quality. All the boring stuff is hidden at the end. Christians are talked about in a non-crazy way.
09-Apr-18	Mortal questions	Thomas Nagel	3	I really like Chapters 1-4 and 10-12. I didn't understand or like the others.
18-Apr-18	The Lady Tasting Tea	David Salsburg	3	Ch 1-13 were good, but then it turns into random portraits. Addresses, but doesn't systematically treat, the thesis, about how stats transformed modern science.
29-Apr-18	Japanese Gardens and Landscapes, 1650-1950	Wybe Kuitert	3	Some good pictures, but tons of history, and I often missed the thread, or worried that the thread I found was his personal thread and not the more "mainstream" one.
09-May-18	Wizard of Earthsea	Ursula K. LeGuin	5	(reread) This is such a great book. Story-telling is great. Character is more than 1D. Devoured it in a day or two.
25-May-18	Darkness at Noon	Arthur Koestler	5	Definitely the most intruiging story "about" Communism, or the most compelling thing about the psychology of philosophy, especially ends and means
27-May-18	The Tombs of Atuan	Ursula K. LeGuin	4	(reread) Again, so much to like here. Gender again front and center, and funny to see Ged from this other angle.
03-Jun-18	The Farthest Short	Ursula K. LeGuin	4	This was better than I remember. Very subtle, and lots of looking and thinking with remarkably little action.
06-Jun-18	Tehanu	Ursula K. LeGuin	4	Way better than I remember, mostly because it's gritty and sad and rough and scary. Like she says, what's this world like for people who aren't wizards?
19-Jun-18	Who are we?	G. Prevelakis	4	Good ideas about the role of nationalism and Hellenism in the future of Greece. I think it's a little confusing, though, if you don't know about Ottoman & Greek history.
22-Jun-18	Fox of the North	Roger Parkinson	4	Great summary of Kutuzov. Seems like there's not much else to read in English. This guy understood the big picture.
15-Jul-18	Tales from Earthsea	Ursula K. LeGuin	4	I always expect "Tales from X" to be mostly a waste, but this is a remarkably well-conceived and -executed little collection. It's also obviously a bridge between books.
17-Jul-18	The Other Wind	Ursula K. LeGuin	4	Never read this one. Better than I expected. Again, I love her little blurbs. It's also cool that somehow death and life became the theme.
20-Jul-18	The RAND Corporation (1989-2009)	Jean-Loup Samaan	2	Not sure this is worth reading. It's *not* a monograph on RAND, so you get a lot of his international theory ideas through RAND anecdotes.
26-Jul-18	A Japanese Garden Manual for Westerners	Samuel Newsom	4	The name sounds super dopey, but it was surprisingly good. There's a little bit of 1960s simplicity, but not too bad overall.
30-Jul-18	A Thousand Years of Japanese Gardens	Samuel Newsom	2	OK, this one you can skip. Some of the photos are good, but it's difficult to read and get a sense of what he's talking about. The guide was way better.
04-Aug-18	Sabriel	Garth Nix	4	Surprisingly good and digestible little piece of fantasy. 20th c. England mashed up with high Medieval fantasy & necromancy.
05-Aug-18	Lirael	Garth Nix	3	A little slower, but about as good as the previous. It's mostly a build-up for the final book.
06-Aug-18	100 Suns	Michael Light	4	Wow, what amazing photos. I also think it's worth reading the bit in the back about his political views and description of the photos. Starfish Prime!
20-Aug-18	Beyond the Northlands	Eleanor Rosamund Barraclough	3	OK stories, weaved together in an OK way, and I can stand the self-deprecation. Just read some sagas!
10-Sep-18	An Introduction to Legal Reasoning	Edward Levi	4	The first section was all impenetrable generalities, and the organization (case law, statutory, Constitutional) wasn't obvious, but the examples and explanation were really good.
12-Sep-18	Birth of Britain	Winston Churchill	4	This is the book I should have read when I was in England trying to learn English history. Engaging, and not overly scholarly. He's actually a really engaging writer.
19-Sep-18	Wild	Cheryl Strayed	3	Actually a pretty good read, weaving together her personal history with the trail. Impressive story of a very, very determined person.
26-Sep-18	Introduction to the Philosophy of Law	Roscoe Pound	2	Legal reasoning was a lot easier to understand, even though its scope was way more limited (just torts). I think an analytical law textbook would have been easier than this old thing.
02-Oct-18	Estate Planning Basics	Denis Clifford	4	First few chapters, about wills and trusts, are really good.
03-Oct-18	Seven Pillars of Statistical Wisdom	Stephen Stigler	3	It's an abridged version of his History, with many many fewer of the dots connected. Still some good examples. I love his illustrations and tables.
03-Oct-18	A Brief History of Boston	Robert Allison	2	Short, and covered a bunch of topics, but not very well-edited or thoughtful.
07-Oct-18	Of Love and Other Demons	Gabriel Garcia-Marquez	3	What a weird story. Very memorable and all really weirdly sad characters.
20-Oct-18	Idylls of the King	Alfred Tennyson	4	Wow, his poetry is really good. Also Arthurian legend is really dark and sexual and violent. Way more interesting than I remember.
05-Nov-18	Out of Africa	Isak Dinesen	3	The first 100 pages get a 4. The rest drags a bit. But wow, wtf colonialism, that just gets thrown in there. People were totally in the matrix.
03-Dec-18	Eleni	Nicholas Gage	5	OK, it's hard to keep track of characters, and sometimes the writing is too flowery, and it's a one-sided story about the Communists, but wow. Probably the most gripping and emotional thing I've read in years.
09-Dec-18	Readings in Western Religious Thought: Ancient World	Patric Reid	3	Lots of boring stuff, but overall surprisingly good. Lots of syncretism in Hellenistic times, early church very diverse in belief. Many strands in the ancient world got combined.
15-Dec-18	Orthodox Catechism	Sotirios Athanassoulas	4	Only one of these I've read, so hard to judge. Surprised by what specific things get focus in this kind of catechism.
30-Dec-18	What I Talk About When I Talk About Running	Haruki Murakami	2	Not sure it was worth reading. I don't think his strength is in writing about himself that much. Although Athens story and thinking about energy were my favorite.
01-Jan-19	Autobiography of Malcolm X	Malcolm X	4	Amazing, if mostly to learn about him from his own perspective. I'm not sure the writing makes it a great work; it's mostly about him and his view and evolution.
18-Feb-19	The Iliad	Homer	4	A lot of killing in the middle, but brilliant moments, and a surprising amount of poetry that can translate. Hecuba's lament for Astyanax's future is maybe my favorite.
01-Mar-19	The Magus	John Fowles	3	I liked the first half, about Greece and literature, but it quickly turned into, god knows what. I agree with Ebert's review of the movie.
